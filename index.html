<h2>Benvenuti / Welcome</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:2cm;">Hi, I'm Matteo and this is my landing page. I'm not familiar with HTML, and I'm not planning to study it sistematically anytime soon either. Nevertheless, the idea of a website has been in my mind for quite some time now, and I recently learned about the easy methods provided by GitHub Pages, so I decided to give it a go. I'm not a professional programmer, although I have a little practice from scientific projects (mainly in C and Fortran languages). So what I plan to do, is to build a somewhat coherent page little by little, one tutorial at a time, hoping to improve my website-building knowledge in the process. Most probably, I will be only scratching the surface of HTML capabilities, but hey, I can be happy already with a simple page such as this.</p>
<p>Project goals (30/4/2020):</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
  <li><s>Make a to-do list</s> -- scratch that</li>
  <li>Write a short bio of myself</li>
  <li>Branch out to a secondary page</li>
  <li>Define an overall styling with CSS</li>
</ul>
